Hi!
In this repo you'll find my experiments with different open APIs available on the web.
Everything was written in Postman and exported in JSON, so you can just import any collection.
There are some automated tests made with Postman snippets and me, testing my JS knowledge =) Those tests are in Swagger_PetStore_Custom.postman_collection
Also these collections are available in my public Postman collections https://www.postman.com/endrust/workspace/my-public-workspace/overview
